# Colour picker

Create a background colour picker. There should be a button on the page that will open the colour palette and will apply the colour to the background upon selection.

Use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color to get started. It should be implemented in React. You can use either https://vitejs.dev/guide/ or https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
